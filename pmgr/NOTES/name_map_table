The *_name_map table has the following fields:
	db_field_name - The name of the field, used to access the PV.  It either
	                starts "FLD_" (indicating that the name is to be appended
			to the base name with a period) or "PV_" (indicating that
			the name is to be appended to the base name with a colon.)
			Double underscores are converted to single throughout.
	alias         - The short name of the field, put into the column header.
	tooltip	      - The tooltip for the field.
        enum          - If the PV is an enum, the possible values are listed here,
			separated by |.  (If this isn't an empty string, the editor
		        will be a QComboBox with the listed values.)
        col_order     - A unique identifier for the field which also gives the
			default column order (low numbers first).
	set_order     - A field giving PV setting information.  This has several
			bitfields:
			    - The low 10 bits are the order.  Order 0 is written
			      first, then order 1, etc.
			    - 0x200 flags this order as a mutex group as well.
			      Fields in a mutex group must have distinct non-zero
                              values.
			    - 0x400 flags a PV that must be written, even if the
			      value doesn't seem to change.
			    - 0x800 flags a PV that must be set to zero first.
			    - 0x1000 flags the "autoconfiguration" PV (the serial
			      number).
			    - 0x2000 flags "readonly" PVs.
	mutex_mask    - If several values are interrelated, this value will be
			non-zero.  It is a bitmask of values in the interrelated
			set.  Several bits can be 1 if this field is in several
			sets.
