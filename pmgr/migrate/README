TL;DR - To convert the first version of the parameter manager database to the
current version, run the following from the top directory:
    cat pmgr/migrate/sql.script |\
        mysql --host=psdb --user=pscontrols --password=pcds --database=pscontrols'
    python pmgr/migrate/fixup.py
    cat pmgr/migrate/sql.script2 |\
        mysql --host=psdb --user=pscontrols --password=pcds --database=pscontrols'

----------------------------------------------------

The first version of the parameter manager had several concepts that were 
ultimately found lacking:
    1. Inheritance of configuration values.
    2. Configuration groups.
    3. Autoconfiguration by serial number lookup.
    4. Unique TYPE reflecting the configuration name.

The code in this directory is aimed at purging the database of these.
The script does the following:
    - Builds out complete configurations, with no inherited values.
    - Fixes the numerous issues in the "mutex" field.
    - Sets all "Auto" entries to "Manual".
    - Deletes the group tables and group entries in the update table.
    - Gets rid of the PN, SN, and TYPE fields.
    - Fixes some set order issues.
