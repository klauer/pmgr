The first version of the parameter manager had three concepts that were 
ultimately found lacking:
    1. Inheritance of configuration values.
    2. Configuration groups.
    3. Autoconfiguration by serial number lookup.

The code in this directory is aimed at purging the database of these.
The script does the following:
    - Builds out complete configurations, with no inherited values.
    - Fixes the numerous issues in the "mutex" field.
    - Sets all "Auto" entries to "Manual".
    - Deletes the group tables and group entries in the update table.
    - Gets rid of the PN and SN fields.
    - Fixes some set order issues.
